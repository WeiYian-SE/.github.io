Dr. Yao Cheng is an Assistant Professor with the Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering, The University of Hong Kong [official website](https://www.imse.hku.hk/people/y-cheng). Dr. Cheng received her PhD degree in Industrial Engineering from Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. Dr. Chengâ€™s research mainly lies in reliability and resilience modeling and optimization of both generic systems such as complex networked systems, and engineered systems and critical infrastructures in specific sectors such as new energy systems (including electrical vehicle charging piles and solar panel systems) and transportation systems. Her research draws tools from deterministic models (e.g., operations research), stochastic models (e.g., probability and statistics, stochastic process) and data analytics methodologies. Her research has been published in and promoted by leading journals in the reliability engineering and industrial engineering such as IISE Transactions, Transportation Science, Reliability Engineering and System Safety, IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics, IEEE Transactions on Reliability, International Journal of Production Research. Her research also has been funded by Research Grant Council, University Research Council, and Industry.
